# mri-to-point-cloud
Inspired by this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/kkg8vg/mri_scan_of_the_entire_human_body/), which references the [Visible Human Project](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_Human_Project) containing detailed cross sectional photographs of the human body.

# Demo

# Creating the point cloud
Run the following python script:
```
./create_point_cloud.py
```

# Viewing the model
Run index.html in your browser. Don't forget to change it to reference your new model file. The existing index.html uses a 3MB model file that was pre-generated from an cross-sectional image in the image/ folder
